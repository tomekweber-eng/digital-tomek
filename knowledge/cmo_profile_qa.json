    {
      "question": "What actions do you take in the first month when supporting a new marketing department in a consulting or project-based role?",
      "answer": "Primarily analysis. First internally – goals, market insights, competition, products/services, brand reputation, and customer research if available. Then – gaining broader knowledge about the sector and competition to identify diversification opportunities or niches. Of course, interviews with leadership unless strategy is well documented. Lastly – reviewing current marketing activities and processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you evaluate the effectiveness of the current marketing strategy, and what do you focus on first?",
      "answer": "Financial results – the most tangible indicator. Then resource and team efficiency: can we do the same or better with less? That tells me a lot about the strategy’s true performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prioritize when the marketing budget is limited or requires cuts?",
      "answer": "Sales strategy and business goals guide me – long-term vs. short-term priorities. I prefer cutting less effective actions in favor of core priorities. I also explore what tech can replace or optimize. Smaller budgets often unlock creativity and bold moves with real sales or loyalty impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools or methods do you use to quickly map the customer journey and identify optimization areas?",
      "answer": "I start with existing data – process maps, CRM insights, campaign performance, and sales reports. Then I talk to the front line: sales, support, product marketing. They often spot friction or drop-off points better than any report."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure sales and marketing alignment?",
      "answer": "I start by talking to sales: about leads, objections, failed deals. Then I map actions to pain points and build supportive tools (not replacements). I like shared KPIs like SQLs or lead-to-sale conversion. I also run deal reviews and deliver fast assets – landing pages, sales kits, or automation sequences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach rebranding or brand repositioning projects?",
      "answer": "By understanding the real reason behind the change. I gather insights on brand, market, internal expectations. Success often hinges on convincing leadership. Then I build a roadmap and touchpoint plan – not everything at once, but with a long-term lens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your proven methods for B2B thought leadership or educational campaigns?",
      "answer": "Legal change is a great trigger – like energy certification for buildings or the EU’s Mobility Package in logistics. These can position the brand as a sector leader. I focus on ideas, policy direction, and expert narratives, not brand slogans."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you audit digital channels (social media, SEO, PPC)? What are the most common mistakes?",
      "answer": "Attention comes first, message second. I often see inconsistent messaging and unrealistic PPC expectations. Success requires a consistent, multi-touch message and integrated strategy, not standalone ads."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you use AI in your projects?",
      "answer": "I use AI to support repetitive tasks (copywriting, research), generate personalized content, and design workflows. I also experiment with agents and GPT for internal tools – like brief generators or QA bots for marketing teams."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure effective collaboration in remote or hybrid teams?",
      "answer": "Clear structure, regular check-ins, and shared tools. I implement communication rituals, async updates, and workflows (e.g., Trello, Notion, Monday). I also focus on autonomy – each person needs to know what they’re accountable for and why."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you build marketing teams in changing or uncertain business environments?",
      "answer": "I don’t build teams for 'status quo' – I design structures to adapt fast. I prioritize cross-functional profiles, process clarity, and automation. I also help clients define roles, upskill existing teams, or hire critical talent (sometimes temporarily)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What skills do you think are essential for the modern CMO?",
      "answer": "Strategic clarity. Data-driven thinking. Empathy. Tech-savviness. And a bias for experimentation. A modern CMO must connect the dots between brand, performance, and business growth – not just run campaigns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your strengths and development areas as a CMO?",
      "answer": "Strength: sharp diagnosis, fast action, and cross-skill execution. I can go from strategy to campaign build in a day. Weakness: I sometimes act too fast and skip over onboarding or teaching moments for others."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you define and measure marketing success in your projects?",
      "answer": "Results and readiness. I measure by engagement, leads, conversions – but also by whether the team and processes are stronger when I leave. Even in permanent roles, I deliver with an interim mindset – clarity, fast impact, and readiness from day one."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you deal with uncertainty and risk in marketing leadership roles?",
      "answer": "I treat uncertainty as normal. I’m hired to lead change. Breaking it into clear steps, involving the team, and providing direction makes it actionable. Clarity kills chaos."
