    {
      "question": "What actions do you take in the first month when entering a new marketing department as an interim?",
      "answer": "Primarily analysis. First internally \u2013 goals, market insights, competition, products/services, brand reputation, and customer research if available. Then \u2013 gaining broader knowledge about the sector and competition to identify diversification opportunities or niches. Of course, interviews with leadership unless strategy is well documented. Lastly \u2013 reviewing current marketing activities and processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you evaluate the effectiveness of the current marketing strategy, and what do you focus on first?",
      "answer": "Financial results \u2013 the most tangible indicator. Then resource and team efficiency: can we do the same or better with less? That tells me a lot about the strategy\u2019s true performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prioritize when the marketing budget is limited or requires cuts?",
      "answer": "Sales strategy and business goals guide me \u2013 long-term vs. short-term priorities. I prefer cutting less effective actions in favor of core priorities. I also explore what tech can replace or optimize. Smaller budgets often unlock creativity and bold moves with real sales or loyalty impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools or methods do you use to quickly map the customer journey and identify optimization areas?",
      "answer": "I start with existing data \u2013 process maps, CRM insights, campaign performance, and sales reports. Then I talk to the front line: sales, support, product marketing. They often spot friction or drop-off points better than any report."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure sales and marketing alignment?",
      "answer": "I start by talking to sales: about leads, objections, failed deals. Then I map actions to pain points and build supportive tools (not replacements). I like shared KPIs like SQLs or lead-to-sale conversion. I also run deal reviews and deliver fast assets \u2013 landing pages, sales kits, or automation sequences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you approach rebranding or brand repositioning projects?",
      "answer": "By understanding the real reason behind the change. I gather insights on brand, market, internal expectations. Success often hinges on convincing leadership. Then I build a roadmap and touchpoint plan \u2013 not everything at once, but with a long-term lens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your proven methods for B2B thought leadership or educational campaigns?",
      "answer": "Legal change is a great trigger \u2013 like energy certification for buildings or the EU\u2019s Mobility Package in logistics. These can position the brand as a sector leader. I focus on ideas, policy direction, and expert narratives, not brand slogans."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you audit digital channels (social media, SEO, PPC)? What are the most common mistakes?",
      "answer": "Attention comes first, message second. I often see inconsistent messaging and unrealistic PPC expectations. Success requires a consistent, multi-touch message and integrated strategy, not standalone ads."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you use AI in your projects?",
      "answer": "I use AI to support repetitive tasks (copywriting, research), generate personalized content, and design workflows. I also experiment with agents and GPT for internal tools \u2013 like brief generators or QA bots for marketing teams."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure effective collaboration in remote or hybrid teams?",
      "answer": "Clear structure, regular check-ins, and shared tools. I implement communication rituals, async updates, and workflows (e.g., Trello, Notion, Monday). I also focus on autonomy \u2013 each person needs to know what they\u2019re accountable for and why."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you build marketing teams in changing or uncertain business environments?",
      "answer": "I don\u2019t build teams for 'status quo' \u2013 I design structures to adapt fast. I prioritize cross-functional profiles, process clarity, and automation. I also help clients define roles, upskill existing teams, or hire critical talent (sometimes temporarily)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What skills do you think are essential for the modern CMO?",
      "answer": "Strategic clarity. Data-driven thinking. Empathy. Tech-savviness. And a bias for experimentation. A modern CMO must connect the dots between brand, performance, and business growth \u2013 not just run campaigns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are your strengths and development areas as a CMO?",
      "answer": "Strength: sharp diagnosis, fast action, and cross-skill execution. I can go from strategy to campaign build in a day. Weakness: I sometimes act too fast and skip over onboarding or teaching moments for others."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you define and measure marketing success in your projects?",
      "answer": "Results and readiness. I measure by engagement, leads, conversions \u2013 but also by whether the team and processes are stronger when I leave. Interim = visible value."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you deal with uncertainty and risk in marketing leadership roles?",
      "answer": "I treat uncertainty as normal. I\u2019m hired to lead change. Breaking it into clear steps, involving the team, and providing direction makes it actionable. Clarity kills chaos."
