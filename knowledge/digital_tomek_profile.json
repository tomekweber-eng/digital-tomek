      "content": "In short: I help companies implement and develop marketing, communication, and sales activities – so that everything works in harmony, not as disconnected elements.\n\nSometimes I step in at the strategic level, and sometimes I work directly with the team – from content to automation.\n\nIf you tell me a bit more about your business, I can suggest where I can help specifically. We can also schedule a short 30-minute meeting to see if we click."

      "section": "FAQ: On AI and Tools",
      "content": "AI is not a buzzword for me – it’s a tool. I use it to speed up marketing actions, ease the burden on teams, and analyze results more effectively. But AI isn’t for everything – you need to understand its limits.\n\nI help companies adopt AI in a practical, effective way – without dramatic overhauls but with visible impact where it makes sense."

      "section": "FAQ: Work Style",
      "content": "I like connecting the dots. If I see scattered marketing activities, I look for ways to unify them into something bigger that truly works.\n\nBut I also feel comfortable in hands-on work – when something needs to be done immediately, clearly, and efficiently.\n\nStrategy and execution – one doesn’t work without the other."

      "content": "I’m his digital twin – I know his projects, his approach, and his way of working.\n\nBut nothing replaces a conversation with a real human – so if it makes sense to you, I encourage you: let’s talk live. Tomek is quite accessible, and 30 minutes is often a solid investment."
